 is broadly classified into three types by etiology and clinical 
presentation, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes
 (GDM). Some other less common types of diabetes include monogenic 
diabetes and secondary diabetes.<a class="bk_pop" href="#" data-bk-pop-href="#article-36052.r2" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">[2]</a><a class="bk_pop" href="#" data-bk-pop-href="#article-36052.r3" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">[3]</a><a class="bk_pop" href="#" data-bk-pop-href="#article-36052.r4" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">[4]</a><a class="bk_pop" href="#" data-bk-pop-href="#article-36052.r5" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">[5]</a></p><p><b>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)</b></p><p>Type
 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)&nbsp;accounts for 5% to 10% of DM and is 
characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells 
in the islets of the pancreas. As a result, there is an absolute 
deficiency of insulin. A combination of genetic susceptivity and 
environmental factors such as viral infection, toxins, or some dietary 
factors have been implicated as triggers for autoimmunity. T1DM is most 
commonly seen in children and adolescents though it can develop at any 
age.</p><p><b>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</b></p><p>Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) accounts for around 90% of all cases of diabetes. In 
T2DM, the response to insulin is diminished, and this is defined as 
insulin resistance. During this state, insulin is ineffective and is 
initially countered by an increase in insulin production to maintain 
glucose homeostasis, but over time, insulin production decreases, 
resulting in T2DM. T2DM is most commonly seen in persons older than 45 
years. Still, it is increasingly seen in children, adolescents, and 
younger adults due to rising levels of obesity, physical inactivity, and
 energy-dense diets.</p><p><b>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</b></p><p>Hyperglycaemia,
 which is first detected during pregnancy, is classified as gestational 
diabetes mellitus (GDM), also known as hyperglycemia in pregnancy. 
Although it can occur anytime during pregnancy, GDM generally affects 
pregnant women during the second and third trimesters. According to the 
American Diabetes Association (ADA), GDM complicates 7% of all 
pregnancies. Women with GDM and their offspring have an increased risk 
of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in the future.</p><p>GDM can be 
complicated by hypertension, preeclampsia, and hydramnios and may also 
lead to increased operative interventions. The fetus can have increased 
weight and size (macrosomia) or congenital anomalies. Even after birth, 
such infants may have respiratory distress syndrome, and subsequent 
childhood and adolescent obesity. Older age, obesity, excessive 
gestational weight gain, history of congenital anomalies in previous 
children, or stillbirth, or a family history of diabetes are risk 
factors for GDM.</p><p><b>Monogenic Diabetes</b></p><p>A single genetic 
mutation&nbsp;in an autosomal dominant gene&nbsp;causes this type of 
diabetes. Examples of monogenic diabetes include conditions like 
neonatal diabetes mellitus and maturity-onset diabetes of the young 
(MODY). Around 1% to 5% of all diabetes cases are due to monogenic 
diabetes. MODY is a familial disorder and usually presents under the age
 of 25 years.</p><p><b>Secondary Diabetes</b></p><p>Secondary 
diabetes&nbsp;is caused due to the complication of other diseases 
affecting pancreas (for example, pancreatitis), hormone disturbances 
(for example, Cushing’s disease), or due to drugs (for example, 
corticosteroids).</p></div><div id="article-36052.s3"><div class="goto jig-ncbiinpagenav-goto-container"><a class="tgt_dark page-toc-label jig-ncbiinpagenav-goto-heading" href="#" title="Go to other sections in this page" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">Go to:</a></div><h2 id="_article-36052_s3_" class="ui-helper-clearfix">Epidemiology</h2><p>Diabetes
 is a worldwide epidemic. With changing lifestyles and increasing 
obesity, the&nbsp;prevalence of DM has increased worldwide. The global 
prevalence of DM was 425 million in 2017. According to the International
 Diabetes Federation (IDF), in 2015, about 10% of the American

 there is cellular-mediated, autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta 
cells. T1DM has a strong genetic predisposition. The major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC), also known as human leukocyte antigens
 (HLA), is reported to account for approximately 40% to 50% of the 
familial aggregation of T1DM. The significant determinants are 
polymorphisms of class II <i>HLA</i> genes encoding DQ and DR4-DQ8, with DR3-DQ2, found in 90% of T1DM patients.</p><p>Another
 form of T1DM is latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA). It occurs 
in adulthood, often with a slower course of onset.</p><p>The rate of 
destruction is generally rapid in children and faster in adults. 
Autoantibodies against islet cells, insulin, glutamic acid 
decarboxylase-65 (GAD-65), and zinc transporter 8 (Zn T8) may be 
detected in the serum of such patients. These antibodies wane over time 
and do not have sufficient diagnostic accuracy to be used routinely for 
diagnosis, especially after the first year. With the progressive 
destruction of beta cells, there is little or no secretion of insulin. 
These patients are generally not obese. They are more prone to develop 
other autoimmune disorders such as Addison disease, Graves' disease, 
Hashimoto thyroiditis, celiac disease, among others. A subset of T1DM 
not associated with insulin autoimmunity and not associated with the 
above HLA is termed idiopathic T1DM. It is commoner in African and 
Asians and presents with episodic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).</p><p>T2DM
 is an insulin-resistance condition with associated beta-cell 
dysfunction. Initially, there is a compensatory increase in insulin 
secretion, which maintains glucose levels in the normal range. As the 
disease progresses, beta cells change, and the insulin secretion is 
unable to maintain glucose homeostasis, producing hyperglycemia. Most of
 the patients with T2DM are obese or have a higher body fat percentage, 
distributed predominantly in the abdominal region. This adipose tissue 
itself promotes insulin resistance&nbsp;through various inflammatory 
mechanisms, including increased FFA release and adipokine dysregulation.
 Lack of physical activity, prior GDM in those with hypertension, or 
dyslipidemia also increases the risk of developing T2DM. Evolving data 
suggest a role for adipokine dysregulation, inflammation, abnormal 
incretin biology with decreased incretins such as glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-I) or incretin resistance, hyperglucagonemia, increased 
renal glucose reabsorption and abnormalities in gut microbiota.</p></div><div id="article-36052.s5"><div class="goto jig-ncbiinpagenav-goto-container"><a class="tgt_dark page-toc-label jig-ncbiinpagenav-goto-heading" href="#" title="Go to other sections in this page" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true">Go to:</a></div><h2 id="_article-36052_s5_" class="ui-helper-clearfix">History and Physical</h2><p>Patients

 diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) should have lifelong
 testing at least every three years. For all other patients, testing 
should begin at age 45 years, and if results are normal, patients should
 be&nbsp;tested at a minimum of every 3-years.</p><p>The same tests are used to both screen for and diagnose diabetes. These tests also detect individuals with prediabetes.</p><p><b>Diagnosis</b></p><p>Diabetes
 can be diagnosed either by the hemoglobin A1C criteria or plasma 
glucose concentration (fasting or 2-hour plasma glucose).</p><p><b><i>Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)</i></b></p><p>A
 blood sample is taken after an 8 hour overnight fast. As per ADA, 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of more than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mm/L) is 
consistent with the diagnosis.</p><p><i><b>Two-Hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)</b></i></p><p>In
 this test, the plasma glucose level is measured before and 2 hours 
after the ingestion of 75 gm of glucose. DM is diagnosed if the plasma 
glucose (PG) level in the 2-hour sample is more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 
mmol/L). It is also a standard test but is inconvenient and more costly 
than FPG and has major variability issues. Patients need to consume a 
diet with at least 150 g per day of carbohydrate for 3 to 5 days and not
 take any medications that can impact glucose tolerance, such as 
steroids and thiazide diuretics.</p><p><i><b>Glycated Hemoglobin (Hb) A1C</b></i></p><p>This
 test gives an average of blood glucose over the last 2 to 3 months. 
Patients with an Hb A1C greater than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) are diagnosed as
 having DM. Hb A1C is a convenient, rapid, standardized test and shows 
less variation due to pre-analytical variables. It is not much affected 
by acute illness or stress.</p><p>Hb A1C is costly and has many issues, 
as discussed below, including lower sensitivity. Hb A1C should be 
measured using the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program 
(NGSP) certified method standardized to Diabetes Control and 
Complications Trial (DCCT) assay. It is affected by numerous conditions 
such as sickle cell disease, pregnancy, hemodialysis, blood loss or 
transfusion, or erythropoietin therapy. It has not been well validated 
in non-Caucasian populations.</p><p>Anemia due to deficiency of iron or 
vitamin B12 leads to spurious elevation of Hb A1C, limiting its use in 
countries with a high prevalence of anemia. Also, in children and the 
elderly, the relation between Hb A1C and FPG is suboptimal.</p><p>For 
all of the above tests, if the person is asymptomatic, testing should be
 repeated later to make a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.</p><p>In 
patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (increased thirst, 
increased hunger, increased urination), random plasma glucose more than 
200 mg/dL is also sufficient to diagnose DM.</p><p>FPG, 2-hour PG during
 75-g GTT, and Hb A1C are equally appropriate for the diagnosis of DM. 
There is no concordance between the results of these tests.</p><p><b>Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</b></p><p>Pregnant
 women not previously known to have diabetes should be tested for GDM at
 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. ADA and American College of Obstetrics and
 Gynecology (ACOG) recommend using either a 1-step or 2-step approach 
for diagnosing GDM.</p><p><b><i>One-Step Strategy</i></b></p><p>75 gm 
OGTT is performed after an overnight fast. Blood samples are collected 
at fasting for 1 hour and 2 hours. GDM is diagnosed if fasting glucose 
meet or exceed 92 mg/dl (5.1 mmol/l), 1-hour serum glucose of 180 mg/dl 
(10.0 mmol/l) or 2-hour serum glucose of 153 mg/dl (8.5 mmol/l).</p><p><b><i>Two-Step Strategy</i></b></p><ul><li class="half_rhythm"><div>Step
 one: Perform a 50-gram glucose challenge test irrespective of the last 
meal. If PG at 1-hour after the load is greater than or equal to

 2: 100 g glucose OGTT is performed after overnight fasting. Cut off

 diet low in saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, fructose corn syrup, 
and high in fiber and monounsaturated fats needs to be encouraged. 
Aerobic exercise for a duration of 90 to 150 minutes per week is also 
beneficial. The major target in T2DM patients, who are obese, is weight 
loss.</p><p>If adequate glycemia cannot be achieved, metformin is the 
first-line therapy. Following metformin, many other therapies such as 
oral sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. 
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-I) receptor agonists, Sodium-glucose 
co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, pioglitazone, especially if the 
patient has fatty liver disease, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and 
insulin, are available. Recent studies have shown that the SGLT2 
inhibitor, empagliflozin (EMPA), and the GLP-1 receptor agonist, 
liraglutide, reduce both significant cardiovascular (CV) events and 
mortality. Hence, in patients with CV disease, these drugs should be 
considered next. For patients with T1DM, a regime of basal-bolus insulin
 is the mainstay of therapy. Also, insulin-pump therapy is a reasonable 
choice. Since hypoglycemia portends increased mortality, preference 
should be given to therapies that do not induce hypoglycemia, for 
example, DPP-4 Inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-I receptor agonists, 
and pioglitazone with metformin. The other advantages of SGLT-2 
inhibitors and GLP-I receptor agonists are a reduction in body weight, 
blood pressure (BP), and albuminuria.</p><p>To reduce microvascular 
complications in the majority, the goal Hb A1C should be less than 7%. 
Also, the BP goal should be less than 130/85 mmHg with a preference for 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 
therapy. Fundal exams should be undertaken as proposed by guidelines and
 urine albumin excretion at least twice a year.</p><p>For the lipid 
panel, the goal should be an LDL-C less than 100 mg/dl if 
no&nbsp;atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or less than 70 
mg/dl if ASCVD present. The drug of choice is a statin since these drugs
 reduce CV events and CV mortality. Consider adding ezetimibe and PCSK9 
inhibitors for patients with ASCVD who are not at goal.</p><p>Since the 
different complications and therapies have been detailed in other 
Statpearls review articles, we have outlined only the principles of
